# My dotfiles

These are various configuration files that I use.

They're not necessarily copyable anywhere, because I use them across Windows
and MacOS, so quite a few of them have to be picked and copied individually.

Some of them (like the poweshell config) also don't go in the home directory,
so be aware of where you're copying them
